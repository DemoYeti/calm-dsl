# Major Feats

## Python2 to Python3 Escript Migration
This release is majorly focussed on  "FEAT 14256 eScript Update to Python 3". Based on the decision that the Python Software Foundation (PSF) took to discontinue support for Python 2, Nutanix has decided to end support for Python 2 on June 30, 2024. 

Customers can use Calm-DSL to update the escripts used in their application from python2 to python3. For detailed explanation refer [here](../../docs/Py2-Py3%20Migration/index.md)
